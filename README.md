## General Info

This project is made purely for fun and it's still under development. I will try to implement Classes and make it more organize. 

Check out my [100 CSS Art Challenge](https://github.com/m-dennisgocong/100CSSArt-Challenge), this is also one of the reason behind making this project so I can shape my ```<div>``` easier and faster when making CSS art. This is based on my personal preference there is a lot of CSS generator Tool you can use. 

## Credits

I took inspiration from [fancy-border-radius](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/) made by [mirko](https://github.com/mirko314mirko) and [Nils](https://twitter.com/supremebeing09). Awesome project, it's very well organized the way they implement Classes and Module I wish I could code like this. Also they use SASS for styling which is way easier to write compared using vanilla CSS.
